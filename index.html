<H1>Hi, Im jay </H1>
<h2>I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and internet tools</h2>

<p> I work as a freelancer from time to time. I love using wordpress for most of my projects as I find it simplyfies the design and development process. Some of my favorite themes include Avada, Xtheme and Rehub for wordpress.</p>

<h2> One other thing I also enjoy learning about amazing internet tools online</h2>

<p> Some of the tools I like most are <a href="https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer"> Coschedule'
